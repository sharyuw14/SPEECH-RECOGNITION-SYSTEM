# DESCRIPTION : This project showcases a simple speech recognition system using command-based control through serial monitor using an ESP32 microcontroller to operate two LEDsâ€”Red (GPIO 2) and Green (GPIO 4). By giving commands such as "red on", "red off", "green on", and "green off" into the Serial Monitor, users can control the LEDs in real time. The project simulates the core concept of voice or speech-controlled automation, making it ideal for beginners exploring embedded systems or IoT. It serves as a foundational step toward building smart home applications and is easily scalable to more devices or advanced input methods in the future.
