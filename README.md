# SPEECH-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM
This project showcases a simple speech recognition system using command-based control through serial monitor using an ESP32 microcontroller to operate two LEDsâ€”Red (GPIO 2) and Green (GPIO 4). By giving commands such as "red on", "red off", "green on", and "green off" into the Serial Monitor, users can control the LEDs in real time.
